# AI Quizz

**This generates a simple multiple choice quizz on any subject matter. The target is for primary/elementary students but anyone may use it.**
**This project uses the power of Generative AI. It has been designed and tested using the Llama v3.0 LLM running under Ollama on MacOS.**
**However, as with all generative AI and LLM, there may be some inaccuracies. Please use with that in mind.**

**I created this project to simplify to allow anyone to further their knowledge on any subject matter. Of course one may use any LLM directly. This hopefully allows one to focus on a certain subject matter.**
**The benefit of this approach is that Ollama runs Llama 3 on device. This means that no server requests are made over the web and no need for AI subscription costs.**
**It's not perfect as it's limited by the accuracy of the LLM used. It's an ongoing project and will be improved as better LLMs come along.**
**All kind constructive comments are welcome.**
